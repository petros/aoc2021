# Advent of Code 2021

I have decided to do something that's 101 do not do it. Solve Advent of Code and
do it using a language I am still learning.

To add to the difficulty, I am using Elixir. As you may know, Elixir is not only
a new language to me. It's also a different programming paradigm. I've spent
most of my programming career using object oriented languages. Delphi, C#, and
Ruby for the most part. Elixir is a functional programming language. Oh my!

The excitment and fear of this deed.

## Organization of code

You will find the functions that solve the examples in `lib/aoc2021.ex`.

You will find the functions that load the puzzle inputs and spit the final answer for each day (both parts) in `lib/aoc2021Solutions.ex`.

I am doing it like that so that you can safely browser `lib/aoc2021.ex` without
any spoilers. You can check how I solve each puzzle, without seeing the actual
answer for each puzzle.

If you want to see the answer, you can check `lib/aoc2021Solutions.ex`.
